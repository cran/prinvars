\usage{
pla(
  x,
  cor = FALSE,
  scaled_ev = FALSE,
  thresholds = 0.33,
  threshold_mode = c("cutoff", "percentage"),
  expvar = c("approx", "exact"),
  check = c("rnc", "rows"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a numeric matrix or data frame which provides the data for the
principal loading analysis.}

\item{cor}{a logical value indicating whether the calculation should use the
correlation or the covariance matrix.}

\item{scaled_ev}{a logical value indicating whether the eigenvectors should
be scaled.}

\item{thresholds}{a numeric value or list of numeric values used to determine
"small" values inside the eigenvectors. If multiple values are given, a list
of pla results will be returned.}

\item{threshold_mode}{a character string indicating how the threshold is
determined and used. \code{cutoff} indicates the usage of a threshold value.
\code{percentage} indicates that the cutoff value is determined by the
maximum element of each vector multiplied with the threshold value.}

\item{expvar}{a character string indicating the method used for calculating
the explained variance. \code{approx} uses the explained variance of each
eigenvector i.e. its eigenvalue. \code{exact} uses the variance of each
variable.}

\item{check}{a character string indicating if only rows or rows as well as
columns are used to detect the underlying block structure. \code{rows} checks
if the rows fulfill the required structure. \code{rnc} checks if rows and
columns fulfill the required structure.}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{
single or list of \code{pla} class containing the following attributes:
\item{x}{
  a numeric matrix or data frame which equals the input of \code{x}.
}
\item{c}{
  a numeric matrix or data frame which is the covariance or correlation
  matrix based on the input of \code{cov}.
}
\item{loadings}{
  a matrix of variable loadings (i.e. a matrix containing the
  eigenvectors of the dispersion matrix).
}
\item{threshold}{
  a numeric value which equals the input of \code{thresholds}.
}
\item{threshold_mode}{
  a character string which equals the input of \code{threshold_mode}.
}
\item{blocks}{
  a list of blocks which are identified by principal loading analysis.
}

data matrix.

\examples{
if(requireNamespace("AER")){
require(AER)
data("OECDGrowth")

## The scales in OECDGrowth differ hence using the correlation matrix is
## highly recommended.

pla(OECDGrowth, thresholds=0.5) ## not recommended
pla(OECDGrowth, cor=TRUE, thresholds=0.5)

## We obtain three blocks: (randd), (gdp85, gdp60) and (invest, school,
## popgrowth). Block 1, i.e. the 1x1 block (randd), explains only 5.76\% of
## the overall variance. Hence, discarding this block seems appropriate.

pla_obj = pla(OECDGrowth, cor=TRUE, thresholds=0.5)
pla.drop_blocks(pla_obj, c(1)) ## drop block 1

## Sometimes, considering the blocks we keep rather than the blocks we want
## to discard might be more convenient.

pla.keep_blocks(pla_obj, c(2,3)) ## keep block 2 and block 3
